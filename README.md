# JavaWebProject
Learning java for web development

This was my first project involving web concepts. My goal with this work was to better understand the fundamentals before starting more robust projects. Thus, I used as a basis the challenge ze-code-challengues ZÃ© delivery/BackEnd, focusing, at first, on the realization of the functionalities 1.1,1.2,1.3.


For database, i used mysql in the following format:

database - partners

id - int  / primary key / auto increment / not null
tradingName - varchar
ownerName - varchar
document - varchar / unique
coverageArea - json
address - json
